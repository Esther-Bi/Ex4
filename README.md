# Ex4
In this project, we used our last project Ex3 (https://github.com/Esther-Bi/Ex3), to make a fun game (:<br>
The game consists of agents (pirets..) whose purpose is to catch the pokemons (diamonds..) appearing on the game graph.<br>
Each pokemon has a different value and so the score the client receives changes according to the pokemon he caught.<br>
We used different data structures such as dictionaries to save our data, to optimize our algorithms.<br>
Explanations about the classes can be seen on Wiki.<br>
An example of running can also be seen on Wiki.<br>
